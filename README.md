Hi there, I'm Peter! 👋
I am a upcoming grad student at the University of Chicago, with the field of Data Science. My academic focus is on using data to drive better decisions in a variety of contexts.

🔭 Current Work
Currently, I'm working on improving my skills in R and Python, and I frequently use SQL in my work as well. I'm proficient in data analysis and have worked on several projects that involve data manipulation and visualization.

🌱 Learning
I'm always interested in learning new things, especially in the areas of risk analysis and management. I'm currently exploring default rate analysis, which I believe has significant potential for improving business and financial decision-making.
